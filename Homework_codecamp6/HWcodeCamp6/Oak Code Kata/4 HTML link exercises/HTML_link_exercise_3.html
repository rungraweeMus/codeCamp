        <h2>Explore England’s Castles This Autumn</h2> 
        England is famous for its ancient castles and some have become famous themselves. Sometimes their 
        comes from their royal residents, such as Windsor Castle. Other times you may recognise them 
        from the silver screen. Indeed Highclere featured in Downton Abbey and Alnwick Castle was the site 
        where Harry Potter learned his wizarding skills and flying a broom. However you know them there’s 
        something magical about seeing these majestic architectural beauties the autumnal months when the 
        leaves begin to fall and the countryside becomes a burnished carpet of reds, golds and yellows. 
        You just know that with millennia of English history behind each turret or wall there will be a
        myriad of tantalising tales and royal gossip.

        <h2>Windsor Castle </h2>
        Just to the west of London lies the world’s oldest and largest inhabited castle, having been a 
        residence for around 950 years. First developed by William the Conqueror in the 11th century, 
        Windsor Castle is regularly used by the Queen as a weekend retreat, as well as hosting state 
        occasions and royal weddings. The Round Tower dominates the skyline and sits atop the oldest
        part of the castle while St George’s Chapel acts as the spiritual home of the Order of the
        Garter – an order of chivalry dating back to the reign of Edward III in 1348.

        <h2>Warwick Castle</h2>
        An imposing fortress in the heart of the Midlands, Warwick Castle provides a taste of medieval
        English life. Pass beneath the castle’s impressive portcullis, wander along its ramparts, 
        take in archery exhibitions and explore 64 acres of landscaped gardens on the way to discovering 
        1,100 years of history. Children can venture back through time in the Horrible Histories Maze, 
        or book into the Castle Dungeon to unravel some of Warwick’s darkest secrets with the help of 
        live actors and spine-tingling special effects.

        <h2>Highclere Castle, Hampshire</h2>
        One of the stars of TV’s Downton Abbey, Highclere Castle in Hampshire provided the backdrop 
        for four series of the show and the hit movie. Initially a medieval palace, Highclere was 
        transformed in the mid-19th century by Sir Charles Barry, the architectural mind behind the 
        Houses of Parliament in London. Alongside tours of its many rooms, including those used as 
        the staterooms from the Downton Abbey movie, visitors can explore gardens dating back to the 
        13th century and 1,000 acres of stunning parkland, designed by the renowned landscape gardener, 
        Capability Brown. The castle is home to the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, whose family have 
        lived there since 1679, and also houses a unique display of Egyptian antiquities celebrating 
        the 5th Earl of Carnarvon’s role in the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. This year, the 
        castle will also hosts special autumn and winter tours, including Real Lives and Film Sets 
        and Christmas at Highclere.

        <h2>Hever Castle, Kent</h2>
        With a history spanning more than 700 years, Hever Castle was the childhood home of Henry 
        VIII’s second wife, Anne Boleyn. Initially a moated defensive castle dating back to 1270,
        this romantic setting is packed full of Tudor portraits and tapestries, and features fine 
        views out over Hever Lake. Set within the 125 acres of grounds is a 100-year-old Yew Maze, 
        as well as award-winning gardens, with startlingly beautiful dahlia displays and the warming 
        sugary scent of the Katsura tree perfuming the frosty air. Pre-booking to explore Hever Castle 
        and its grounds is essential.
