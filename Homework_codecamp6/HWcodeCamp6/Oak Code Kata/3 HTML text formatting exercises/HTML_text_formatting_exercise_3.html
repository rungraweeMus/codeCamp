    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A comprehensive guide and workbook for improving ESL/EFL students' understanding 
    of English articles, The Article Book can be used as either a supplement to any ESL/EFL core text or as a self-study tool for 
    intermediate through advanced learners. Cole involves students in "learning by doing" through an integrated 
    approach to skill acquisition that includes other grammar structures, reading, vocabulary, and speaking.</p>

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each chapter of the book is organized into teachable units or lessons and
     includes presentation of a grammatical rule with examples, exercises, quizzes, and a comprehensive test. While the fifty 
     rules (and fifteen exceptions) are taught to provide a logical framework for the text and serve as a handy reference, 
     students will learn through guided practice instead of memorization.</p>
