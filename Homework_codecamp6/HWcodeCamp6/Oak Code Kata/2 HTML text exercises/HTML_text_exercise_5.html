            <u>The Red Badge of Courage</u> is an 1895 war novel by American author <u>Stephen Crane.</u> It is considered one of the most <b><i>influential</i></b> works in American literature. The novel, 
            a depiction on the cruelty of the American Civil War, features a young recruit who overcomes <b><i>initial</i></b> fears to become a hero on the battlefield. The book made Crane an 
            international success. Although he was born after the war and had not at the time <b><i>experienced</i></b> battle firsthand, the novel is considered an example of Realism.
